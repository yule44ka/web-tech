# ArtLoop – Online Digital Art Gallery

## Idea

Create a platform where digital artists can upload their artworks, and users can browse, like, comment, and "purchase" them as unique digital items.

## Setup Instructions

### Quick Start with Bash Scripts

For quick setup and launch, use our bash scripts:

```bash
chmod +x start.sh
./start.sh
```

These scripts will check prerequisites, set up the database, and start the application automatically.
